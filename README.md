## Characters Quiz
A random silhouette representing a character will appear. The user will have to input their answer in the already focused input field. When they input their answer, if it was correct they will get a point and the image will be colored! If they get it incorrect, they will get an incorrect point and the text will change, telling the user what the correct answer was! All of the quizzes have many random options that can show up. No option can show twice in a row, but options will repeat themselves, making the game virtually infinite, until the user decides it's enough! The user can then click the Save & Back button to save their current score for the Scores Table in the home page and return to the Quiz Selection section to continue on playing!

## Features left to be implemented
-	I would have liked to put an actual image for the background, but I couldn't find the way to make it look good with all the other elements of the page.
-	I would like to put a relaxing background music from the show to play while the user is in the website.
-	Like all quizzes, what makes them good is the diversity of the questions. With more time and resources I would have put way more options for all the different quizzes, reflecting the proportions of the world of One Piece!
-	Following some user feedback given to me, in the future I would also add a way to let the user decide to either save their current score or to reset it, letting them start from blank without them needing to reload the page.
